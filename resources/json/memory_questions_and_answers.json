    "question": "What is memory addressing management in Python?",
    "answer": "Memory addressing management in Python is the process of managing the memory used by Python objects and variables. It involves allocating and freeing memory, tracking object references, and ensuring efficient use of memory. Python handles memory addressing management automatically through reference counting and garbage collection techniques."

    "question": "What is the difference between mutable and immutable objects in Python in terms of memory addressing?",
    "answer": "Mutable objects, like lists and dictionaries, can be modified after creation, and their memory may be reallocated if their size changes. Immutable objects, like strings and tuples, cannot be changed once created. Any operation on them creates a new object, without altering their existing memory allocation."

    {
    "question": "What is the Python memory addressing model and how does it affect object creation?",
    "answer": "Python uses the stack and the heap for memory addressing. The stack stores local variables and function calls, while the heap is used for dynamically allocated memory for objects. Python manages objects in the heap, allocating memory when objects are created and releasing it when they are no longer referenced, using garbage collection."

    {
    "question": "What is the purpose of Python’s garbage collection?",
    "answer": "Python's garbage collection automatically frees memory by removing objects that are no longer in use. It uses reference counting to track the number of references to an object. When the reference count drops to zero, the object is deleted. Additionally, cycle detection helps manage circular references that reference each other."

    "question": "What is a memory addressing leak in Python, and how can it occur?",
    "answer": "A memory addressing leak in Python occurs when memory that is no longer in use is not released. This usually happens when references to objects are unintentionally kept, such as in the case of circular references that the garbage collector fails to detect."

    "question": "What are weak references in Python?",
    "answer": "Weak references are references to objects that do not prevent them from being garbage collected.

    "question": "How does Python’s memory addressing usage differ between small and large integers?",
    "answer": "Python pre-allocates and caches small integers (from -5 to 256) to optimize memory usage. These integers are stored in a special region and reused whenever possible. Larger integers are dynamically allocated and use more memory because they can represent larger values."

    "question": "What is the memory addressing layout of a Python object?",
    "answer": "Python objects have a specific memory layout consisting of: 1) Object header, containing reference, type, and metadata; 2) Data area, which stores the object's actual data (e.g., list elements); 3) Memory overhead, which stores size and other management data. This layout varies based on the object type."
